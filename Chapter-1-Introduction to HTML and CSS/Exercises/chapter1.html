    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 250°C (482°F).</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, dissolve the yeast in warm water and let it sit for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the yeast mixture and olive oil to the flour mixture and stir until a dough forms.</li>
        <li>Knead the dough on a floured surface for about 10 minutes, until it is smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour, or until it has doubled in size.</li>
        <li>After the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into two equal portions.</li>
        <li>Roll out each portion on a floured surface to your desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer the rolled-out dough to a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
        <li>Spread tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the grated mozzarella cheese evenly over the sauce.</li>
        <li>Add your desired toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza in the preheated oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and top with fresh basil leaves.</li>
        <li>Slice and serve immediately. Enjoy!</li>
